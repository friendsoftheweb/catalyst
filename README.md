# ðŸ§ª Catalyst &middot; ![CI](https://github.com/friendsoftheweb/catalyst/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Catalyst is an opinionated tool for creating and maintaining React applications. It sets up webpack, TypeScript, React, Apollo, SASS, Autoprefixer, and more!

## Starting a New Project

```
$ yarn add catalyst
$ yarn run catalyst init
```

## Starting the Development Server

You can start the development server with:

```
$ NODE_ENV=development yarn run catalyst server
```

By default, the server will be accessible at http://localhost:8080. You can override this by setting
`DEV_SERVER_PROTOCOL`, `DEV_SERVER_HOST` and/or `DEV_SERVER_PORT` environment variables.

If you want to be able to access your development server from other devices on your local network,
you can start it like this:

```
$ DEV_SERVER_HOST=`ipconfig getifaddr en0` yarn start
```

Where "en0" is the identifier for the network device you're using.

## Integrating with Rails

See: https://github.com/friendsoftheweb/catalyst-rails

## Configuration

Certain aspects of Catalyst can be configured by editing the `catalyst.config.json` file in the root of your project. Some options can also be configured via environment variables (which take precedence over the value in `catalyst.config.json`). _The server must be restarted before any changes to the configuration will take effect._

### Configuring Webpack

Catalyst automatically creates a webpack configuration that should
be sufficient for most projects. If a project does require manual webpack configuration, a `webpack.config.js` file can be added to the root of the project.

Catalyst exports a function which returns Catalyst's default webpack configuration as an object:

```javascript
const { webpackConfig } = require('catalyst');

const customConfig = webpackConfig();

customConfig.module.rules.push({
  loader: 'my-custom-loader',
});

module.exports = customConfig;
```

### Analyzing Webpack Output

The size of the bundles output by webpack can be visualized using [webpack-bundle-analyzer](https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer). You can open the analyzer by starting Catalyst server with the `--bundle-analyzer` option:

```
$ NODE_ENV=development yarn run catalyst server --bundle-analyzer
```

## Using Catalyst

### Importing Images

Images can be imported as URLs via a standard ES import statement:

```js
import thisIsFineUrl from 'assets/images/this-is-fine.gif';

const Component = () => {
  return <img src={thisIsFineUrl} />;
};
```

The image's dimensions can also be imported as an object:

```js
import thisIsFineUrl, {
  dimensions as thisIsFineDimensions,
} from 'assets/images/this-is-fine.gif';

const Component = () => {
  return (
    <img
      src={thisIsFineUrl}
      width={thisIsFineDimensions.width}
      height={thisIsFineDimensions.height}
    />
  );
};
```

Make sure the assets TypeScript definitions have been added to your project (usually "client/assets.d.ts"). If they're missing, running `yarn run catalyst init` will add them to your project.

### Prefetching Important Assets

Catalyst has experimental support for generating a list of files to [prefetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Link_prefetching_FAQ) (via `<link rel="prefetch" />`). The files associated with any chunk which includes a JavaScript or TypeScript file with a `// @catalyst-prefetch` comment in it will be added to a `prefetch.json` file that's output during any non-development build.

This file can be used to generate link tags to allow important assets to be fetched before a user navigates to a part of the site that requires them. For example, to start loading the assets required for the checkout process before a user reaches the checkout process, a hypothetical "Checkout" component could be updated to include the `@catalyst-prefetch` directive:

```js
// @catalyst-prefetch

import React from 'react';

const Checkout = () => {
  return (
    // ...
  )
}
```

_NOTE:_ This will have no effect if the file is included in an "entry" chunk (i.e. the file is not part of a [dynamically imported](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import#Dynamic_Imports) chunk).

### Logging Apollo Client Errors During Development

Catalyst provides a global error logger method (`window.__CATALYST__.logger.error()`) that can be used to display an error message at the bottom of the browser window during development. This can be used to display GraphQL and network errors by adding a [custom "link"](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/data/error-handling/#network-errors) to your `@apollo/client` configuration:

```jsx
import { ApolloClient, HttpLink, from } from '@apollo/client';
import { onError } from '@apollo/client/link/error';

const link = from([
  onError(({ operation, graphQLErrors, networkError }) => {
    if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
      if (networkError != null) {
        window.__CATALYST__?.logger?.error({
          location: operation.operationName,
          message: networkError.message,
        });
      }

      if (graphQLErrors != null) {
        for (const error of graphQLErrors) {
          window.__CATALYST__?.logger?.error({
            location: operation.operationName,
            message: error.message,
          });
        }
      }
    }
  }),
  new HttpLink({
    // ...
  }),
]);

const client = new ApolloClient({
  link,
  // ...
});
```

## Common Issues

### Requiring an MJS module causes the webpack build process to fail

If you see a message like this during a webpack build:

```
BREAKING CHANGE: The request './version' failed to resolve only because it was resolved as fully specified
(probably because the origin is a '*.mjs' file or a '*.js' file where the package.json contains '"type": "module"').
The extension in the request is mandatory for it to be fully specified.
Add the extension to the request.
```

You should make sure that every version of `@babel/runtime` used in your project
is at least `7.12.0`. You can check this by running `yarn why "@babel/runtime"`.
If any versions are lower than `7.12.0`, either update the parent dependency or
add `@babel/runtime` to the ["resolutions"](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/selective-version-resolutions) section of your `package.json`.
